             <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> During these past few months, I have been learning about how to make webpages on GitHub since it is much easier to use for collaboration than the previous programs we used. I’ve learned what commands to use and how to use the integrated development environment (IDE) for projects. I’ve practiced using commands and using HTML and CSS code to make smaller webpages while collaborating with partners. This project, specifically, is a larger project worked on with a deadline. My teacher, Mr.Mueller, gave us this project called <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i>. This project helps us learn how to collaborate using GitHub while also allowing us to practice linking between files. The requirements for this project were to make it using Markdown, but a challenge was given to make it using HTML and CSS, which I did. </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p> My partner and I got our topic from Mr.Mueller, our teacher. Students chose certain topics we wanted to do, and He paired us up with a partner who wanted to do a similar project. My partner and I matched on the topic <i>Avoid Mr.Mueller</i> because our teacher said it's allowed to make projects on him. So this project is about avoiding making Mr.Mueller Disapointed in not following the Instructions he gives us daily. For example, after cloning a project into our IDE, he tells us to “CD into the Repo”, meaning make sure your terminal is in the repository you just cloned. So basically, it’s about following instructions, and if you don’t follow them, you might have to run away to safety. This project is also not meant to make my teacher seem bad, either, so in advance, my teacher isn’t actually like this.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
            <p> One Challange me and my partner faced was the titles for some of our HTML files. Usually, it’s recommended to make titles of any files without uppercase letters, spaces, and not using any periods in the title since they are usually used to define what type of file it is, such as it being a CSS file or an HTML one. We had to rename many of our files just so it can work. But, in the end, the project turned out well, and we learned it’s best to follow Mr. Mueller's instructions, like our adventures tell us to do.</p>
            <p> Another challenge my partner and I faced was files not linking correctly because of Miscommunication. Our project was split on our Google Drawing, and this is where we divided all our work. Unfortunately, we both worked on the same portion of the project, just on different HTML files, and I linked them together. But then there was another section added to the other HTML file that wasn’t there in the first place, because I changed some of the titles of the HTML files, because I didn’t want them to contain any periods. So I had to readjust the files I linked so they would properly fit the story and also work. All of this could have been avoided if my partner and I communicated on how to do each part better and had saved us some time, but we still completed the project. </p>
            <h2>The Next Step</h2>
            <p>  I personally would want to add some better CSS, since on other projects I have done much better with that aspect. But this project had a shorter deadline than those projects, so I couldn’t play around with it as much as I would have wanted to. I would get a better background, and also actually upload it into the repository instead of using a link to do so. If that image gets taken down, then I won't be able to access it, and my project will look bland. I could have also worked better on Padding and formatting, making better space between each text box. I could have also done a better title page, with a better font. But those are some things I may do in the future for this project.</p>
