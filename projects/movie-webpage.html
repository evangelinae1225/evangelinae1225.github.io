            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p> When my SEP 10 class finished learning Basic HTML and CSS, our teacher, Mr.Mueller, gave us a project to work on so that we could practice and use our new skills that we acquired. The prompt was               to make a website about a hypothetical movie that included CSS elements such as borders and HTML elements such as classes and IDs. Then we got assigned a partner and started brainstorming on movie ideas.  </p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>My partner and I both had an interest in the sports manga called <i>Blue Lock</i> by Muneyuki Kaneshiro, so we decided to make a movie based on its Neoegoist arc and World Cup arc. <i>Blue Lock</i> is a soccer manga, and the Neoeogist arc is about the selection of Blue Lock participants who get to play in the World Cup. While the World Cup Arc is finally where the selected participants get to play. After we decided on our topic, we decided to brainstorm what we could do to complete the project requirements. We aswell planned the color schemes, fonts, and images that we would like to use. 
              </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
            <p>
           One challenge that my partner and I experienced was centering the bullet points. When the size of the screen changed, the bullet points moved so far away from the text, the text didn’t look like bullet points. So we asked Mr.Mueller for some help. Eventually, we figured that we could use <code class="language-X"> list-style-position: inside; </code> in the CSS, and now the bullet points were together. So from this challenge, I learned asking for help is normal, and aswell how to make sure the bullet points stay together with the text. 
           </p>
           <p>
Another challenge was finding images with the Creative Commons license that are about <i>Blue Lock </i>. Since <i>Blue Lock </i> is a copyrighted anime, it was very difficult, but I remembered the image I used from a previous project, and decided to reuse it. As well, the second image I used was a soccer ball, and I figured that using it was fitting because it's a soccer movie, and that image wasn’t as hard to find. So I learned, it's useful to reuse resources from previous projects, especially while programming. 
          </p>
            <h2>The Next Step</h2>
            <p> If I had more time, I'd probably add on to the storyline. The World Cup arc is still updating, so every Tuesday, I could add on to the project. As well, I'd like to add a gradient background since I wanted to add it to my final result, but never got my hands on actually writing the code for it. </p>
